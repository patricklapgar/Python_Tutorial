# Python_Tutorial

I started learning python earlier this year from various online resources to help prepare me for a Python class at my university. 
After passing the class, I took it upon myself to learn more about the language since I could see myself using it more in the future.

This repo is a free and public resource for anyone to use if they need a quick reference to learning Python's subtle, but fascinating, features.

### Note: This repo is still a work in progress and I will probably be adding more directories and files to it for a while... like a long while. 

##### Links to the websites and other resources I used to help me will be included in the not-too-distant future
